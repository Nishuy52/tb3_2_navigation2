map_relay.py

Relays /map to /{ns}/map with TRANSIENT_LOCAL durability, buffering the
last received map so that late-joining subscribers (like the global costmap
static_layer) always receive it immediately on connection.

topic_tools relay does NOT buffer TRANSIENT_LOCAL messages. If slam_toolbox
publishes /map before the global_costmap subscribes to /{ns}/map, the costmap
misses it entirely and logs "Can't update static costmap layer, no map received"
until the next publish cycle (every 5s). This relay stores the latest map and
re-publishes it to every new subscriber immediately via TRANSIENT_LOCAL.

Usage: python3 map_relay.py <target_topic>
  e.g. python3 map_relay.py /tb3_2/map
